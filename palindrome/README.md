# palindrome string

A palindrome string is a string in which comparing the regular order of characters in the string equals to the reverse order of characters of that very same string. An example of such a string is the following: `1234321`. This string, when read in from front to back is exactly the same as if read from back to front. Such a string is called palindrome.

The palindrome check is an algorithm which determines, if a string read forward is exactly the same as if read backwards. Another example of such a string would be `was it a car or a cat i saw` assuming whitespaces are not considered part of the validation/evaluation.
