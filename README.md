# onealgorithmaday

A repository in which I try to keep my algorithmic skills trained. I did get inspired by this when we started hiring new members for my team.

Algorithmic skills are the foundation for many software development engineering challenges and they keep the brain fresh and trained for solving complex puzzles. I try to submit samples on a continuous basis (weekly is realistic) to keep the skill trained.

**Note:** the focus is on algorithms and the algorithmic design. Using pre-built libraries and frameworks is not the goal for this repository. For many of these algorithms, you might find better, more comprehensive frameworks and libraries, but this would be counterproductive for the goal of training the logical thinking muscle needed for designing algorithms.

Currently covered algorithms:

| Algorithm                  | Path                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Palindrome string          | [./palindrome](palindrome/README.md)                 |
| Prime number check         | [./prime](prime/README.md)                           |
| Sieve by Eratosthenes      | [./primeeratosthenes](primeeratosthenes/README.md)   |
| Shuffle cards              | [./shuffle](shuffle/README.md)                       |
| Simple pattern match       | [./simplepatternmatch](simplepatternmatch/README.md) |

All samples are implemented with `C# / .NET` and `Python`.
